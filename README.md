## Why this plugin

This local `1.5.0-codex.rc1.3` adaptation is based on upstream 1.4.4 and pinned to official Harness `0.1.2-rc.1`; it is not an upstream release and does not modify DSH source. Shared deployments use a separate `DSH_HOME` and workspace to keep private Sessions and unrelated plugin APIs out of the shared service.

| Native Harness, preserved | Collaboration, added | Identity, ready for deployment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sessions, Agent presets, models, permissions, Think/tool trajectory, approvals, questions, slash commands, stop/queue/steer, and retries stay native. | Shared rooms, presence, mentions, replies, reactions, rich media, forwarding, multi-select, branches, notifications, group management, and private chat. | Local accounts, administrator provisioning, roles, account revocation, `dsh-auth`, enterprise OIDC/SSO, automatic provider redirect, and an edge `forward_auth` contract. |

The plugin is out-of-tree and does **not** modify DeepSeek Harness. Initialization is asynchronous; until storage and Sessions are ready, or if startup fails, both chatroom and native Session APIs return `503` to prevent bypassing account authorization.

## Core capabilities

### Integrated plugin build

The `1.5.0-codex.rc1.3` package integrates the `codex/chatroom-next-20260909` development work. Named AI mentions are durably accepted before shared-room activation and use each participant's native inbox; repeated mentions do not cancel one another. Cancelling or changing a participant rejects its late replies and failure notices; immediate retries wait for the previous activation and release to finish. Client requests are scoped to their account generation and selected management room, preventing stale responses and stuck settings controls.

Settings distinguish room AI from human membership, keep long instructions collapsed, and report success only after a successful save. Responsive layout checks cover 320/360/390/768/1280px. Slow SSE connections use the native writable buffer with a backlog limit and drain deadline; native event-answer permissions are consumed once and removed when their logical stream ends. These are local regression guarantees, not production throughput or real-device/provider acceptance.

### Candidate: sign-out and authorization boundaries

Background tabs also keep their room and notification SSE streams closed when a late session response arrives; returning to the foreground reconnects them. AI roster reads time out after 15 seconds, release their busy controls, and offer retry. This bounds a stalled read without automatically repeating configuration writes.

**Settings → Chatroom & accounts** now starts with the current account, permission guidance, and **Sign out**, even without an active room. Sign-out revokes only this browser's chatroom session, not the upstream enterprise SSO session. A failed request preserves the real signed-in state and offers retry. Successful sign-out and account acceptance clear plugin caches for administration, global policy, personal WeCom authorization, search, branch messages, and forwarding.

| Authority | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Platform super-admin | Accounts, login providers, global settings, room membership/AI management; not other users' private sessions |
| Settings allowlist | Global settings only; no implicit account or room-management grant |
| Legacy platform `admin` | No implicit extra grant; existing records remain compatible, but the UI no longer creates this ambiguous role |
| Room owner / room admin | Members, AI configuration and automatic-reply policy in that room; only the owner assigns room admins |
| Room member | Room chat, AI mentions, authorized sessions, and personal account; no management-policy writes |

Members no longer see plugin global model/prompt management panels. The policy API returns empty restricted fields; non-managers retain AI names, short roles and status, but not detailed instructions, model routes or reasoning configuration, including live events. Room-admin demotion immediately updates connected clients. Native Harness may still display its own settings navigation; the server continues to deny deployment/filesystem calls to unauthorized accounts. This is not process isolation for untrusted users: use restricted presets and a minimal working directory.

### Shared rooms and human-first AI

- The workspace sidebar groups activity into **Group / Solo / Direct**. Shared Rooms appear under Group, native one-person Agent Sessions under Solo, and every available platform account under Direct. Because a category merges every Workspace, the per-Workspace "show more sessions" buttons are expanded and replaced by one show-more control per category whose count matches the folder count.
- In authenticated deployments, Solo Sessions are owned by the account that creates them. A member sees only joined Groups and owned Solo Sessions; hidden or foreign native Sessions cannot be opened or submitted through the chatroom UI, and an unauthenticated or newly switched account never inherits the previously selected transcript.
- **New session** keeps the native welcome screen and composer, with Group selected by default in a Group/Solo switch. The first regular Group message creates its Room; Solo remains a native one-person Agent Session.
- Human messages synchronize in real time. `@AI` and direct forms such as `DeepSeek please answer` request an Agent reply without consulting the decision model; rooms may also enable model-controlled replies for other messages without an explicit mention.
- Messages sent while an Agent turn is still running are broadcast to every participant immediately and remain as ordinary participant bubbles after the in-progress answer. AI admission runs independently: the same bubble shows decision or queue status plus **Guide**, **Edit**, and **Withdraw** controls only to its sender. A decline removes the AI status without moving the bubble or disturbing the current answer; a selected or explicitly addressed prompt becomes the next user turn after the prior answer. Guide moves the original prompt into the active turn, edit withdraws it before model admission and restores its text to the composer, and withdraw cancels it before the model can claim it.
- **Settings → Chatroom & accounts** selects the global auto-reply decision model and edits separate system prompts for the main/branch Agent and the auto-reply decision Agent. Prompt changes apply to the next turn without restarting Harness.
- The native `@` menu lists the Agent and current room members together. Participant identity is attached on the Host before Session admission, so browsers and the model see the same sender.
- Shared Session rows retain the native sidebar while adding a roomier member-avatar collage. Native Session renames update the durable room title, so the name survives navigation and restarts.
- Group, Solo, and Direct reuse the room composer layout and interaction model. Their transcript and composer use the full available conversation column instead of the native fixed-width cap.
- The Session header shows the current identity, online count, and **Group management**.
- **Room AI participants** go beyond the single main Agent: room managers add named AI members with a short visible role, optional long model-facing instructions, an exact provider/model route, model-advertised reasoning effort, and an enable switch. Profiles persist in the plugin's independent `chatroom_agents` storage unit, physically separate from the legacy `chatroom` domain. The native `@` menu routes a mention only to the selected member, which runs on its own durable room+profile Session and re-enters the shared room stream under its own name. Runtime state (`queued`, `running`, `failed`, `cancelled`) is streamed live to room clients; members may cancel a running participant without deleting its profile or history. Activation and response waits are bounded, stale profile activations are discarded, and a failed or timed-out participant is released so the next mention can recover without blocking other members or the room. Public failure bubbles are deliberately generic; detailed provider failures stay in Host logs.

### Complete native Agent runtime

- The native sidebar, Conversation/Trajectory tabs, composer, model and permission selectors, reasoning/tool flow, Session log, approvals, questions, slash commands, stop/queue/steer, failures, and retries remain intact.
- The room composer adds **Stop** and **New session**. Stop cancels the active Agent turn while retaining queued input. New session keeps the room's visible Session and complete transcript, first shows a new-AI-conversation divider above the composer, and then permanently keeps it before the next participant message. The server persists the matching context boundary so later AI requests contain only messages sent after that point. Concurrent requests coalesce into one reset.
- While an Agent is running, Think and tool rows stay visible. Once the final answer arrives, the preceding process rows collapse into one expandable summary.
- Persistent branches open in a right-side panel and own independent Harness Sessions. They follow the parent room's human-first reply policy: an explicit `@AI` enters the branch Agent immediately, other messages use the configured decision model when automatic replies are enabled, and otherwise remain human-only messages. Branch Sessions reuse the room's native message wrappers, completed-process folding, emoji/file actions, and Quick meeting action while retaining their own model, permission, trajectory, and stop controls. They also support Markdown, `@` candidates, quotes, reactions, forwarding, and selection without nested chatroom branches. Clicking the backdrop closes the drawer without changing the selected parent Session. Their sidebar rows use a compact marker and parent context instead of a heavy edge stripe, keeping the hierarchy visible without making the branch look like a second room. Each room keeps its two most recently updated branches visible and provides an independent expand/collapse control for older branches; the parent badge reports the same rendered branch total instead of counting stale directory records, while the Group folder count includes top-level rooms only. Gateways that reject embedded documents switch immediately to an inline compatibility view instead of waiting for a timeout, with the complete Agent available in a new tab.
- Historical images remain durable. For text-only models, only the model request receives deterministic text markers in place of image input; the UI keeps the original media.

### Messaging and media

- Verified profile images from IOA, OIDC, and other enterprise providers appear in messages, member directories, the native `@` menu, invite lists, private chat, and room collages. Missing or failed profile images fall back to the account's stable cartoon avatar.
- Consecutive messages from the same participant form one compact visual group: the first and last bubbles keep outer rounded corners, intermediate bubbles use joined corners, and exactly one action/timestamp row retains the group's layout height. It stays on the final message by default and moves to an earlier message while that message is hovered, without shifting the transcript. Compact in-composer reply quotes, the expanded common-emoji picker, reactions, Markdown, image previews, and authenticated file upload/download remain available. Text-only messages bypass attachment preparation, appear immediately, and clear the settled draft.
- HTTP and HTTPS text is rendered as clickable links immediately. Recognized `docs.qq.com` URLs resolve their page title asynchronously and add a native Tencent Docs card only after useful metadata arrives; blocked or failed lookups leave the original message unchanged. Official `doc.weixin.qq.com` links use the current platform account's isolated Enterprise WeChat authorization to resolve richer metadata when available.
- Pure image and file messages render directly—no extra “sent an image/file” placeholder bubble. Oversized images are resized before entering Harness attachment storage.
- Global search opens as an overlay over the current conversation and matches visible account names, usernames, Group/Direct/branch titles, and archived message text. Selecting a result opens its conversation and scrolls to the matching message block.
- Reply, copy, like, branch, and forward are available from the message row; the reaction picker, multi-select, and sender-only recall remain available from the overflow/context menu, with a mobile bottom sheet. Recalled messages become synchronized tombstones and lose their reactions and selection state.
- Merged forwarding is rebuilt from authoritative Session events and retains text/Markdown, media, quotes, nested forwards, and reaction counts.
- The Agent receives room-scoped tools for capability discovery, proactive messages, file delivery, replies, reactions, branch creation, member invitation, and recalling its own messages. Tool actions use the same durable room records and live events as human operations.

### Enterprise WeChat collaboration

- The official [`@wecom/cli`](https://github.com/WecomTeam/wecom-cli) supplies calendar CRUD, attendees/free-busy/rooms, meeting lifecycle/minutes/transcripts, document search and permissions, online sheets, smart sheets, and smart documents.
- Agents read each live operation definition with `wecom_schema` and execute it with `wecom_action`. Every operation uses the current turn speaker's isolated Enterprise WeChat authorization. People are resolved through contacts instead of guessed or exposed internal IDs. Missing authorization or an individual CLI failure remains isolated from plugin and Harness startup.
- **Quick meeting** in Group, branch, and Direct uses the initiating platform account's personal authorization, so that person is the Enterprise WeChat organizer. Every other current conversation participant is resolved through contacts and supplied as an attendee; the organizer is not redundantly invited, and unresolved or ambiguous required attendees stop creation before any meeting is created. The card posts immediately to the originating conversation; Solo intentionally omits the action. Agents can manage further attendees through the official meeting operations. Meeting cards refresh with the same owner's authorization from `init` to `started` and `end`. After a Group or branch meeting ends, the configured meeting-summary model summarizes verified meeting metadata and available official notes, then posts the result back as a standard AI message that can be copied, quoted, forwarded, or selected. Meeting and document results render as native cards with titles, times, attendees, owners, status, and links instead of plain text.

### Accounts, SSO, and private chat

- Optional local password registration, super-administrator account provisioning, roles/status, password rotation, disabled-account revocation, and one identity reused across rooms.
- Pluggable authentication through local accounts, [`dsh-auth`](https://github.com/hxy91819/dsh-auth), or enterprise OIDC Authorization Code with discovery, PKCE, state, and nonce.
- The chosen external provider can automatically receive unauthenticated users; `local=1` keeps a local recovery entry.
- Durable private conversations are visible only to their two participants. Group, branch, and Direct render through the same participant-message frame and reuse the same reply preview, emoji picker, pending-file rail, copying, reactions, forwarding, and multi-select controls; Direct only keeps its private transport separate. Enter-to-send, Shift+Enter newlines, images, files, Quick-meeting cards, and the same unread/toast/browser-notification channel remain available. The Direct folder is also the account directory: clicking any profile switches the main Harness conversation area to that chat, while selecting any Group or Solo Session—including the already-selected Group—switches away directly without a separate close step.

### Storage and backup

- The plugin owns a SQLite chat archive at `$DSH_HOME/chatroom/chatroom.sqlite` (or `~/.dsh/chatroom/chatroom.sqlite`). It projects rooms, branches, private conversations, membership, messages, attachment metadata, and recall tombstones into queryable tables. Harness Session logs remain the authoritative Agent execution and audit history; they are not used as the only chat database.
- File bytes are stored outside SQLite in a SHA-256 content-addressed Blob tree under `blobs/v1/objects/`. Duplicate bytes share one object, while attachment rows retain the original name, media type, sender, room, and creation time. Legacy inline Base64 records migrate on startup without changing message references.
- Recall is non-destructive: the archive retains the original row and records who recalled it and when. Every client receives the tombstone, and the recalled model message ID is removed from future main-room or branch model requests.
- Back up or move the complete chat archive by stopping the plugin and copying the configured data directory. Set `dataDirectory` or `DSH_CHATROOM_DATA_DIR` to place SQLite and Blobs on a dedicated volume.

<details>
<summary><strong>Recent releases</strong></summary>

- **1.5.0-codex.rc1.3 (local integration build)** — Integrates independent AI mention delivery, room/account-scoped request ownership, bounded roster loading and background SSE recovery, account logout and permission boundaries, and container-based phone/foldable settings and composer layouts. The Harness cohort and plugin storage boundaries are unchanged. See `docs/integration-rc1.3.md` for acceptance limits.

- **1.5.0-codex.rc1.2 (local compatibility build)** — Hardens room AI participants with separate long role instructions, exact reasoning-capability selectors, live per-member queued/running/failed/cancelled state, member cancellation, bounded activation/response recovery, stale-activation cleanup, generic browser-safe failure text, and a compact scrollable narrow-screen Agent header.
- **1.5.0-codex.rc1.1 (local compatibility build)** — Adds and hardens room AI participants: independent `chatroom_agents` persistence, short role plus optional long instructions, exact model-capability reasoning selectors, live per-member runtime state and cancellation, bounded activation/response recovery, stale-activation rejection, generic public failure text, and isolated room+profile Sessions whose named replies re-enter the shared stream without blocking peers.
- **1.4.4-codex.rc1.4 (local compatibility build)** — Shows the main Agent and the real native child catalog directly in the room header, with continuation buttons, activity, errors and refresh. Children retain their separate native Sessions; this does not turn `@` Session references into peer-Agent dispatch or combine all child replies in the room feed.
- **1.4.4-codex.rc1.3 (local compatibility build)** — Fixes blank navigation when opening a native child: the UI now asks the existing server lineage authority instead of treating every child as an unowned Solo.
- **1.4.4-codex.rc1.2 (local compatibility build)** — Adds account-scoped native subagent catalog, continuation, and stop controls; foreign parent/child addresses remain denied.
- **1.4.4-codex.rc1.1 (local compatibility build)** — Targets DSH 0.1.2-rc.1 without changing or downgrading Harness. Reuses the native Typert RPC/WebSocket mux behind account authorization, migrates Session/UI contracts, and preserves native optimistic-message IDs. The native transport cohort is pinned and fails closed on untested versions.
- **1.4.4** — authorize native HTTP, WebSocket, and cross-session references on the Host; bind Enterprise WeChat credentials and invitations to structured step admission; deliver files through the actual Agent filesystem; persist input before handing it to the native durable inbox; and dispose borrowed-Agent registrations and CLI children on unload.
- **1.4.3** — isolate Enterprise WeChat QR credentials per platform account because the official meeting-create operation cannot override its authenticated organizer; create Quick meetings as the initiating user, invite every other conversation participant, keep lifecycle polling on the creating credential, and route Agent operations through the claimed turn speaker while retaining the former shared credential only for pre-upgrade meeting lifecycle records.
- **1.4.2** — bind every authenticated Solo Session to its creating account, hide unjoined Groups and foreign Solo Sessions from the native sidebar, omit inaccessible default-room state, clear the previously selected transcript before and after account changes, and reject native prompt or slash-command submission before it can bypass room membership or sender identity.
- **1.4.1** — restore the native Group transcript's single action rail: the host flow owns visibility for ungrouped native rows, the final message keeps the idle rail, and hovering an earlier grouped message moves that rail without exposing every row at once.
- **1.4.0** — replace per-user Enterprise WeChat authorization with one deployment-wide account managed in Settings; add disconnect/rebind controls, meeting lifecycle status, configurable AI summaries, and authenticated summary APIs; unify Group, branch, and Direct message/composer primitives; add immediately shared participant bubbles with editable/withdrawable/steerable AI admission controls that preserve an active answer; validate branch-root capability coordinates; and apply the parent room's human-first automatic-response controller to branch messages.
- **1.3.5** — keep implementation detail out of member-facing copy: the identity dialog no longer explains the embedded chat interface, the unavailable Enterprise WeChat row states a next step instead of naming the CLI, the branch loading and fallback notices describe the branch rather than the embedding strategy, the settings subtitle follows the signed-in role, and the system-prompt hint drops its self-referential wording.
- **1.3.4** — expand the native per-Workspace session truncation and give each sidebar category a single show-more control whose count matches its folder count, instead of several native buttons stranded mid-list by the flattened categories.
- **1.3.3** — unify the full-width Group, Solo, and Direct composer experience, persist the AI-context reset divider at its exact transcript position, and add Enterprise WeChat QR authorization with Quick-meeting compatibility for identity responses that omit a structured human user id.
- **1.3.2** — retain the complete room transcript when starting a new AI conversation and exclude every earlier user, assistant, and tool-result message from later model requests.
- **1.3.1** — polish branch navigation with a closer marker and no parent edge stripe, replace the generic Settings navigation gear with a semantic group/account icon and safe fallback, and add browser coverage for the layout and settings navigation.
- **1.3.0** — add room Stop/New-session controls, official schema-driven wecom-cli Agent tools, Quick meeting, and native meeting/document cards while keeping Enterprise WeChat authorization failures isolated from Harness startup.
- **1.2.5** — append ordinary room and branch messages before the optional automatic-response model runs, and repair historical tool-call/result ordering from older chatroom builds before requests reach the model provider.
- **1.2.4** — add the plugin-owned SQLite chat archive and content-addressed local Blob store, migrate legacy inline attachments, enforce membership visibility in authenticated deployments, and make recall remove the original model message from future Agent context.
- **1.2.3** — attach the room capability and action tools when a shared Session is already running before the chatroom adopts it, so native Harness-restored Agents receive the same collaboration tools as plugin-created Agents.
- **1.2.0** — serialize auto-reply settings with message admission, wake the Agent deterministically for direct AI addressing, add durable sender-only recall, remove the redundant private-chat Settings entry, and expose the complete room action set as model-callable Agent tools.
- **1.1.17** — keep compact reply quotes inside the native composer card and show verified IOA/OIDC profile images in native member mention candidates, with cartoon fallbacks.
- **1.1.16** — target DeepSeek Harness 0.1.1-rc.2, add Group/Solo/Direct navigation, native private messaging with files and emoji, streamlined new-Session mode selection, room pinning, automatic AI wake-up controls, and distinct AI/member mention groups while retaining the 1.1.15 IOA profile and native Session fixes.
- **1.1.15** — add a Chromium regression gate for branch theme and geometry, and keep the full-width mobile branch panel inside its viewport.
- **1.1.14** — make the Harness action row expand around injected AI branch activity instead of letting the summary overlap the sticky composer.
- **1.1.13** — match branch panels and reply summaries to the inherited light/dark color scheme, and keep AI branch activity in normal message flow above the composer.
- **1.1.12** — bind every native sidebar collage to its authoritative Session ID, so duplicate titles, selection changes, and row reordering cannot swap room avatars.
- **1.1.11** — keep room-collage identities and ordering stable while navigating, and include enterprise profile images in the initial room directory.
- **1.1.10** — carry dsh-auth/IOA and OIDC profile images across every chat surface while retaining deterministic cartoon fallbacks.
- **1.1.9** — persist native sidebar renames as room titles and add taller shared-Session rows with member-avatar collages.
- **1.1.8** — replace blocked native branch frames with an immediate messaging fallback, retain direct access to the complete Agent, and collapse Markdown-heavy branch subjects into compact titles.
- **1.1.7** — keep isolated branch runtimes on their target Session instead of navigating back to the parent room during startup.
- **1.1.6** — attach every new or resumed branch Session to the native Workspace so the retained Harness iframe can select it without timing out.
- **1.1.5** — create a group and select platform members directly on the native blank-Session screen.
- **1.1.4** — guarantee distinct native New Sessions and exclude branch Sessions from blank-Session reuse.
- **1.1.3** — replace copied invitation links with direct account-directory selection.
- **1.1.2** — rebuild **Settings → Chatroom & accounts** in the native Harness Settings design language.
- **1.1.0** — make Harness Sessions shared by default, add account/SSO administration, and prefer installed `dsh-auth` as the initial login provider.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.19 or later
- pnpm 10.33.4
- DeepSeek Harness 0.1.1-rc.2 is the tested minimum; the durable inbox and native connection APIs require this version.
- A working default model selection in the Harness Web profile

### Regression gates

`pnpm check` runs type checks, observable-behavior tests, and production builds. CI additionally installs Chromium and runs `pnpm test:browser`, which verifies the branch panel's computed light/dark colors, compact Group/Direct message geometry, queue-row layout and native-queue suppression, branch hierarchy, AI branch activity, and the semantic/fallback group/account Settings icon. These browser assertions deliberately use geometry and computed styles instead of screenshot snapshots.

## Install from GitHub

When upgrading, remove the previous plugin record before installing the current repository:

```sh
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web remove deepseek-harness-chatroom
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add github:invclaw/DeepSeek-harness-chatroom
pnpm dsh --profile web
```

For a local checkout:

```sh
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add /absolute/path/to/DeepSeek-harness-chatroom
pnpm dsh --profile web
```

The browser bundle is discovered through the plugin's `dsh.client` manifest. New Sessions default to Group and bind to a shared Room only when their first regular message is sent; Solo remains native. The plugin contributes identity status, categorized sidebar folders, the account directory, group management, input candidates, and file/reply controls without replacing the conversation, details, or native text composer.

### Account authorization and input persistence

The bundle disables the native `connection` entry and supplies account-authorized HTTP/WebSocket routes while running the pinned native browser connection implementation. Do not re-enable the original entry alongside it. The Host checks room membership or Solo ownership per request and outgoing event, filters session directories and reference candidates, and guards prompts, attachments, exports, approval responses, and cross-session references. Unknown Remotes are denied; deployment settings, credentials, and the global plugin inspect directory require an administrator.

Chatroom supplies collaboration and Session authorization within a shared Harness workspace. Agents still follow the deployment's filesystem, Shell, and permission policies; mutually untrusted tenants requiring process or file isolation need separate Harness instances.

Agent Enterprise WeChat and invitation actions use the structured initiating identity from messages admitted to the current model step. Passive chat does not replace an executing identity. If a step admits multiple participants, operations requiring one personal identity fail and require a separate request from one user. Invitations still require an owner, room administrator, or platform super administrator. Each tool invocation captures its credential owner before execution, and meeting polling retains that owner.

Agent file delivery resolves paths through that Agent's `ctx.fs`, uses the native Session `cwd` as its root, and enforces canonical containment, bounded reads, and cancellation. Symlinks outside that root are rejected.

Human input first reaches an acceptance record in the `chatroom` storage domain. The native durable inbox schedules execution; the acceptance record remains until the claimed `user/message` is flushed to the Session log, protecting unclaimed work from inbox cancellation during native Agent disposal. Recovery deduplicates by message ID and leaves unclaimed work paused; the sender can Guide, edit, or withdraw it. Interrupted auto-reply decisions recover as ordinary history without retrying uncertain external operations. Complete backups retain the chat archive, the configured `chatroom` domain backend, and Harness Sessions. Recall and AI-context reset filters live in the domain; a Session-only export cannot restore them.

Unloading unregisters tools, system-prompt sections, and step listeners from borrowed Agents, cancels decision requests, closes connections, and awaits CLI child exit while retaining the native Agent's lifecycle owner.

### Enterprise WeChat authorization

The dependency is installed with the plugin, so no global CLI install is required. Each platform account opens **Settings → Group chat and accounts** and scans its own Enterprise WeChat QR code. The same panel disconnects or rebinds only that account. Quick meeting also opens this personal QR flow when required and resumes the pending meeting after authorization completes. The official CLI encrypts each account's credentials below `wecomCliConfigDirectory/accounts/<participant-hash>/` (or the chat data directory's `wecom-cli/accounts/` when unset); container deployments must persist the containing directory. The former deployment credential is never assigned to a new user and is retained only to finish lifecycle tracking for meetings created before this change. When one account is not authorized, only that account's Quick meeting and Agent Enterprise WeChat actions pause; ordinary rooms, Agents, and other users continue to run.

### Meeting status and summary API

The plugin polls active meeting cards every `wecomMeetingPollIntervalMs`. On the first 1.4 startup it recovers pre-1.4 meeting cards from durable Group, branch, and Direct history by their meeting URL, so already-created meetings also receive lifecycle updates and one completion summary. Completed Group and branch meetings are summarized once and appended to their originating conversation; Direct meeting summaries remain queryable but are not broadcast into an unrelated room. **Settings → Group chat and accounts → Meeting summary model** selects the provider and model used for new summaries. Only verified meeting fields and official notes are sent to that model.

Authenticated clients can reuse the durable projection through `GET /plugins/deepseek-harness-chatroom/api/meetings/:id` and list completed summaries with `GET /plugins/deepseek-harness-chatroom/api/meetings/summaries`. Each record includes the public meeting id, source conversation kind/id, lifecycle and summary state, times, and summary text. Responses never expose the provider meeting ID, and the caller must belong to the source Group, branch parent Group, or Direct conversation.

`authSecret` encrypts OIDC client secrets and hashes no passwords directly; keep it stable and outside Git. Local passwords use salted scrypt and accept 6–128 characters. The first password registration must present `authBootstrapToken` and becomes the initial super administrator. Later registrations follow the mutable policy in **System administration**. Login attempts are bounded in memory, disabling an account revokes all its sessions, and changing a password rotates the current session and revokes older ones. The authentication cookie is random, stored only by SHA-256 digest, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, root-scoped, and `Secure` whenever `authPublicOrigin` uses HTTPS.

### Enterprise OIDC and dsh-auth

Add OIDC providers from **System administration**. The displayed callback URL must be registered exactly at the identity provider. Discovery and the authorization-code exchange use OIDC discovery, PKCE, state, and nonce; the client secret is stored with AES-256-GCM under `authSecret` and is never projected back to the UI. The first enabled external provider automatically becomes the unauthenticated entry; **Unauthenticated entry** can select a different provider or restore the login chooser. In `hybrid`/`local` modes, add `local=1` to the original application URL to reach the local-account recovery form; bootstrap always remains on the local registration page.

To reuse [`dsh-auth`](https://github.com/hxy91819/dsh-auth), keep its `/auth/*` routes on the same public origin and set `DSH_CHATROOM_DSH_AUTH_VERIFY_URL` to its loopback `/auth/verify` URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:3080/auth/verify`). Verified dsh-auth accounts are ordinary chatroom members unless their stable subject appears in `authDshAuthSuperAdminSubjects`; the edge `admin` role is not a chatroom role. Production can set `authMode: dsh-auth-only`, disable self-registration, and keep the 60-second upstream revalidation interval. Local password and OIDC entry points are then hidden, and revoked upstream sessions stop working at the next validation; the `local=1` recovery switch is available only in `hybrid`/`local` modes. Avatar URLs are HTTPS-only, optionally generated with `authDshAuthAvatarUrlTemplate` and constrained by `authDshAuthAvatarAllowedOrigins`; failed loads fall back to the built-in avatar. `authDshAuthHeaders` remains a trusted-gateway compatibility switch and is disabled by default.

### Whole-site edge enforcement

Enabling the plugin's account APIs does not by itself make a publicly reachable Harness secure. Keep Harness loopback-only and configure the public TLS proxy to:

1. Return `404` for public requests to `/plugins/deepseek-harness-chatroom/api/auth/verify`.
2. Proxy only the explicit login/register/logout, `/auth/page`, `/auth/providers`, OIDC, and dsh-auth callback routes without authentication.
3. Run every other Harness page, asset, API, plugin, SSE, download, and WebSocket request through an internal `forward_auth` subrequest to that verify URL.
4. Pass the original URI as `X-Original-URI`, convert a `401` plus `X-Dsh-Auth-Login` to a `303` only for top-level page navigation, and preserve `Set-Cookie` returned by verification.
5. Remove inbound `X-Dsh-Auth-User-Id`, `X-Dsh-Auth-Subject`, `X-Dsh-Auth-Username`, `X-Dsh-Auth-Display-Name`, `X-Dsh-Auth-Picture`, and `X-Dsh-Auth-Roles` before copying verified values. Authentication still works without the four profile headers, but the chatroom can then show only the account name and cartoon fallback.

The verifier returns `204` with verified identity headers, or `401` with the standalone login location. This arrangement keeps the authentication edge independent from Harness startup: the plugin registers immediately, reports `503` until its own storage is ready, and a provider discovery/login failure does not prevent Harness from starting.

Platform super administrators and accounts listed in `settingsAdminParticipantIds` can read and modify deployment configuration. The list defaults to empty and can be extended through `DSH_CHATROOM_SETTINGS_ADMIN_IDS`. Authorization uses the stable `participantId` resolved from the cookie; changing a display name or avatar does not change access. Model configuration requests must also pass the same-origin check.

`sessionId` remains the persistent Session for the pre-upgrade lobby. A newly created native Session first belongs to its creating account; selecting Group creates the room record on the first regular message, using that exact Session ID. Room managers add active platform accounts from the Group management drawer. Every branch still receives an independent persistent Session.

API routes register immediately and return `503` until identity storage and Sessions are ready. Startup failure leaves static pages available while chatroom and native Session operations stay closed. Correct the storage or Session error and restart the plugin.

## Browser identity and security

When authentication is disabled, the legacy browser identity still receives a random 256-bit token in an API-scoped `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict` cookie. This mode identifies participants but is not an access-control mechanism. When authentication is enabled, the account cookie described above is authoritative for rooms, files, images, settings administration, notifications, and private conversations.

A display name is presentation, not authentication. Remote Models authorization compares the opaque `participantId` resolved by the server from the HttpOnly cookie and never trusts the editable display name. The configuration carrier retains API Proxy schema validation, secret redaction, and revision-conflict checks; credentials are write-only and never returned, while Session operations require ownership or membership and deployment configuration and filesystem management require an administrator. Every participant who can reach the room can still submit input to the configured Agent preset and may use its tools. Use a restricted preset and narrow `cwd` for rooms exposed beyond a trusted team.

## Verify

1. Open Harness Web and finish login or first-time identity setup. No floating **Shared sessions** button should appear.
2. Use the native **New session** action. The Session must automatically become a shared room while retaining the sidebar, Conversation/Trajectory tabs, native composer, and Session log.
3. Open **Settings → Chatroom & accounts** and verify account, registration, and SSO administration lives there instead of a custom modal.
4. In a private window or another browser sign in as `Bob` so the platform account is available to Group management.
5. Send ordinary text from Alice. Both pages must synchronize it without an AI reply. Typing `@` must list both AI and Bob; mentioning Bob must stay human-only, while mentioning AI must wake the Agent.
6. Select **Reply** below a human message. The composer must show the quote, and both browsers must render the same quote after sending.
7. Insert an emoji through **Emoji**, then send a pure image and a pure file. Only the media or download card must render, without a "sent a..." text bubble; the other browser must download the original file bytes.
8. Run `/new`, approval and question interactions, and stop/queue/steer flows through their native Harness paths.
9. Open **Group management** in the Session header. As a manager, search the platform account directory, check Bob, and add him directly; the drawer must then show both participants and presence. Rename the room as its owner, promote Bob, and rename it again as Bob; membership, title, and roles must survive reload.
10. Choose **Branch** from a human or AI message's overflow menu. The panel must contain the complete native Harness conversation. Verify model and permission selection, image/file upload, stop/steer, slash commands, approval/question interactions, Think/tool trajectory, and retry UI. With automatic replies disabled, an ordinary prompt such as `Hello` must remain a human-only message while `@AI Hello` starts the branch Agent; with automatic replies enabled, ordinary prompts must pass through the configured decision model. Typing `@` still lists AI and room members, and every Agent output stays in the branch. Reply, react, forward, and multi-select a branch message; no nested chatroom branch action may appear. After four messages, close the panel and verify the root's total and latest three replies.
11. Choose **Multi-select** from the overflow menu and confirm every human and AI message receives a checkbox. Select messages containing Markdown, quotes, images, files, and reactions, merge them into **Project two**, and verify the target card retains all of those fields.
12. Enter another shared room and confirm that display-name and avatar setup is not requested again.
13. With an image already in room history, switch to a text-only model and send `@AI summarize` in both the main room and a branch. Both must answer while the historical image remains visible.
14. Reload and restart Harness. Identity, Session-to-room bindings, membership, reactions, branches, and every Session context must recover.
15. Add the current identity's `participantId` to `DSH_CHATROOM_SETTINGS_ADMIN_IDS`, then open **Settings → Models** from the remote URL. The provider directory and editor cards must load; a second identity that is not allowlisted must receive an authorization error.
16. Sign in as Alice and Bob in separate browsers. Open **Settings → Chatroom & accounts** for both and confirm that each account has an independent Enterprise WeChat state and QR code; disconnecting or rebinding Alice must not change Bob's state.
17. In a Group containing Alice and Bob, create a Quick meeting as Alice. Alice must be the Enterprise WeChat organizer, Bob must be invited, and neither the former deployment account nor any non-member may appear. Repeat as Bob and confirm that the organizer and invitee reverse.
18. Repeat Quick meeting from a branch and a Direct conversation. The branch must invite every parent-Group member except its initiating organizer; Direct must invite the other participant. An unbound initiator must see a personal QR dialog, and the pending meeting must publish automatically after that user completes authorization.
19. Make one required participant absent or ambiguous in the initiating user's Enterprise WeChat contacts. Creation must fail before the meeting-create operation, identify the unresolved display name, and leave the conversation without a false meeting card.
20. Start an Agent Enterprise WeChat action from Alice's claimed message, then from Bob's. Each action must use that turn speaker's isolated authorization; a speaker without authorization must receive a personal scan instruction instead of falling back to the former deployment account.

The health endpoint is `/plugins/deepseek-harness-chatroom/api/health`; direct Harness Web deployments may also use `/chatroom/api/health`. A ready room returns:

```json
{"ready":true}
```

## Development

```sh
corepack pnpm@10.33.4 install
corepack pnpm@10.33.4 run check
```

## Candidate phone and foldable layout

The independent candidate includes a plugin-owned responsive layer. Settings forms use their actual container width: wide panes can show two card columns, while narrow panes stack fields. At 640 CSS pixels or below, only the native dialog displaying Chatroom settings gets horizontal settings navigation. Other native sections are unchanged. Phone/coarse-pointer controls have 44px touch targets, safe-area spacing and readable inputs. Short landscape views reserve more space for messages; compact composer actions retain accessible names.

This is viewport/container adaptation, not hardware hinge detection. Chromium coverage includes 320–1440px widths, short landscape and unfold/refold draft retention. Real foldable hinges, software keyboards, Safari and the final deployed Host still need device/integration acceptance. No Harness source or database migration is involved. See [integration acceptance boundaries](docs/integration-rc1.3.md).
